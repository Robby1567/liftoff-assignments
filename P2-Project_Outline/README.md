## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A website for shopping with integrated inventory management to help anyone that is working for the shop have an easier time doing so. This site will work with production and shipping systems
making peoples jobs easier. I got that idea from a place I once worked where I would have a lot easier time working if the systems were more accurate. For the next part of the website I was thinking 
we could add a point system, spend money get points, save up enough points you can buy coupons, gift cards or even some products, as well as having mini-games based on chance such as pay points
to try and roll the dice or pick the right card to win something or even maybe spending points into a sweeptakes to see if your name is pulled to win something big! I feel like this is a very
important part of the site because it has the ability to bring people back to the site to check out what they could win this month or to just see what new options they have to spend their points on.
Which we can then show our monthly deals in an add for alongside all the things they can spend their points on. This idea I got from Microsoft rewards.
